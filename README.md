# task3
This C++ code implements a Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm. It fills in missing numbers on a 9x9 Sudoku board while ensuring constraints are met. The `solveSudoku` function recursively tries numbers, while `isSafe` checks for validity. The `printBoard` function displays the completed board.
